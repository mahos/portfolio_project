                  The name of this business in Japanese means “to open”, and is a wordplay between a reference to a protective Egyptian deity, Aker, and the office’s location - on a street with a name <i>Akezu</i> meaning “not opening”.  The graphic design focuses on the Egyptian god’s reference of the business name. The muted color was chosen to fit the city of Kyoto’s business landscaping guideline in case the office wants to put up a sign in the front.

                  Logo series for open source project DataJoint and related products. Original logo with the yellow top reflected their mission of making scientific data analysis efficient through clear and organized combination of data. Joint section of the boxes become transparent and we made the top open to show that inside content is not only transparently visible but accessible. Monochrome version of the logo were created for T-shirt printing purposes 
                  (one color is so much cheaper!). Once company took the direction to focus more on neuroscience, new logo was created to showcase the neuroscience and neural network specialization. If one looks closely, they can spot a neuron at the center of the new logo. Lastly, logo for DataJoint labbook is one of the logos created for their open source series product. It was important that the logo showed the product's connection to their open-source 
                  side of services so the original color scheme and box-like appearance was used.

                <p>This was a personal project brought to me by a friend who had her daughter diagnosed with a rare disorder and wanted to create a group for building awareness and fundraising. Just like the well prepared, super-mom she is, she already had a sketch, color and list of fonts she wanted to pair the logo with. My job was to make the sketch into a vector art and show variations with different font styles so she could make the final decision on what to use as their logo.</p>

                <p>This is a logo design for a local research laboratory that studies how brain makes decisions. The request was to create an icon that could be seen two ways like an optical illusion. One way the icon can be viewed is as foldable sheets of paper, and the other way is with the L alphabet popping outward (physically impossible to recreate). The text for the logo has little walking feet as a pun with the name of the lab. There was another version where the last B alphabet was shaped more like a pair of shoes 
                  however, the regular font version was chosen and we opted for a more subtle nuance.</p>

                <p>This is a logo in progress for a consulting company specializing in providing AI solutions for education and training. In contrast with the tech-y nature of the company, I was requested to emphasize the "geo" side as its name suggests. Starting with a water and mountain themed icon,
                  we eventually agreed to abstract it into a bean or a stone like shapes. It's still in progress because the logo will go into 1-2 more round of revisions to reflect the more "sprouting" nature of education and the tech side of the business.

                <p>This is a showcase of one of the quickest logo jobs created with a single on-the-spot brainstorming session. This logo is for a personal website and the icon represents the vocal characteristic of the represented person. The name is written in Japanese characters with background set to a 
                  traditional Japanese pattern motif (ichimatsu-moyo: think Demon Slayer, main character) to reflect the Japanese heritage of the client. Set to a monochromatic tone, logo is ready to be printed in case the client wants to produce his personal merchandise.

                <p>One of the first logos I've worked on - and this is for a neuroscience laboratory. Principal investigator gave me the freedom to create however I wanted, so logo was designed based on ideas from enthusiastic graduate students and postdocs of the lab. The icon is a pyramidal neuron with an eye (lab collects neuronal data from visual cortex), and the 
                  alphabet A and T embedded. Inspired by the high Greek representation within the laboratory, the icon color scheme, eye design and font style was chosen to reflect that. Given that this was one of my earliest logo works, I feel like it might have a borderline yogurt brand vibe but nobody has objected thus far so we will keep it until the next overhaul occasion.
